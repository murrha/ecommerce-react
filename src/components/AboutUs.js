       <h2>Hi! I'm Pinky</h2>
       <p>I loved art the moment I picked up a crayon and drew the walls of my old bedroom. </p>
       <p>I hope to bring a sense of peace and tranquility with my works... or at least something cool to admire!</p>
       <p>I've worked with clients such as Dreamworks, Disney, and Netflix Animation. My works have also been featured in different parts of the world such as the USA, France, and Japan.</p>
